#Fordson

Fordson is a child theme for Moodle's core theme Boost.

It is built on Boostrap4 and Mustache templates.

Here are the main enhancements:
* Presets - Both uploaded and a set of pre-installed presets to quickly adjust colors
* Colours - A variety of color pickers to help customize and fine tune presets
* Images - Custom Login, Custom Page Header, Custom Course Header, and Custom Page Background image uploads
* Social Icons - Quickly add all your social media buttons in the footer
* Enhanced Frontpage - Navigation Iconbar, Custom Textbox, Alertbox, Six Marketing Tiles
* Customized Course Header Image - Teachers can upload an image into their course summary files and it will automatically be used in the header of their course.

##Recommended Settings for Best Results
These settings below are found in the Moodle Site Administration Pages.  These are not related to the theme but will help bring out the best of Fordson.  

* defaulthomepage = SITE (Default homepage for users.  If set to Dashboard your users will not see the Enhanced Homepage upon login.)
* frontpage = none (Frontpage items to show. Part of Moodle Frontpage Settings tab.)
* frontpageloggedin = none or Enrolled Courses (Frontpage items to show when logged in. Part of Moodle Frontpage Settings tab.)
* Optional: forcelogin = Checked (This forces users to login before seeing the homepage.)

Fordson is a child theme of Boost.  
This means when Moodle updates the core Boost theme those changes will be applied to Fordson as well in most cases.

#Install from Github
Click on the button to "Clone or Download" https://github.com/kennibc/moodle-theme_fordson . When downloaded to your computer, unzip it. It should create a folder named "moodle-theme_fordson-master". Rename the folder so that it is "fordson" (without quotes). You can FTP that folder to your moodle site in /moodle/theme/ directory. Or you can create a new ZIP file of the "fordson" folder and upload and install it via the Plugin Administration in Site Administration.
